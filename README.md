# Library Management System (Visual Basic 6.0)

This is a desktop application for managing a library, developed using **Visual Basic 6.0** and likely utilizing a Microsoft Access database (`Member.mdb`) for data storage.

## Project Structure

The core application files are located in the `Librar` directory:

- **`.vbp` (Visual Basic Project File):** The main project file.
- **`.frm` (Form File):** Contains the visual layout and code for each form (e.g., `lib1.frm`, `loginform.frm`).
- **`.frx` (Form Binary File):** Contains binary data for the forms (e.g., images, control properties).
- **`.bas` (Module File):** Contains global code and procedures (e.g., `Module1.bas`).
- **`.mdb` (Microsoft Access Database):** The database file (`Member.mdb`) used for storing library data.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Visual Basic 6.0
- **Database:** Microsoft Access (`.mdb` file)

## Setup and Running

1. **Prerequisites:** You must have **Visual Basic 6.0** installed on a Windows operating system to open and compile this project.
2. **Database:** Ensure the `Member.mdb` file is accessible by the application.
3. **Open Project:** Open the `Librar/library.vbp` file in the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE.
4. **Run:** Press F5 or click the Run button in the IDE.

## Maintenance Notes

- **Code Quality:** The code is written in an older style of Visual Basic. Modernization is not feasible without a complete rewrite in a newer language (e.g., C#, Python, Java).
- **Security:** The application relies on older technologies and may have security vulnerabilities inherent to VB6 and Access.
- **Portability:** The application is strictly limited to the Windows operating system.
